# MinesweeperExcel
A version of Minesweeper created in an Excel spreadsheet with VBA To see the code open the file in Excel and go to the VBA IDE.

# How to Play:
- Double click to uncover a square.
- Right click a cell after selecting it to flag it as a bomb.
- Double clicking on an uncovered number will uncover all the uncovered squares around that number that aren't flagged. This is a time saver but may set off bombs if you haven't flagged them correctly!


# Notes:
This was the first thing I ever created with programming! I did it when I had started my job as a graduate mechanical engineer with Jaguar Land Rover and initially wasn't very busy. I saw how useful macros in Excel were in my team so I started learning how to program them and this became my pet project.

I was working on adding a high score table, but it remains unfinished as I eventually had to start doing normal engineer work!
