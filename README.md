# MinesweeperExcel
A version of Minesweeper created in an Excel spreadsheet with VBA To see the code open the file in Excel and go to the VBA IDE.

# How to Play:
- Double click to uncover a square.
- Right click a cell after selecting it to flag it as a bomb.
- Double clicking on an uncovered number will uncover all the uncovered squares around that number that aren't flagged. This is a time saver but may set off bombs if you haven't flagged them correctly!


# Notes:
This was the first thing I ever created with programming! It was towards the end of 2013 when I had started a job as a graduate mechanical engineer and had very little to do. I started learning how to program macros in Excel and used this became my pet project.

I was working on adding a high score table, but it remains unfinished as I eventually had to start doing normal work!
